title: "Hello there!"

I am a PhD student within the Infinite Dimensional Dynamics team at GIPSA-lab under the supervision of [Christophe Prieur](http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/~christophe.prieur/) and [Francesco Ferrante](http://www.fferrante.net/). My interest lies in mathematical methods for systems and signals. 


I graduated from Ecole Centrale de Lyon and Université Claude-Bernard in Engineering and Applied Mathematics in 2019.

## Research interests
* Infinite-dimensional systems theory (stability, frequency-domain analysis, decay rates);
* Control of partial differential equations (nonlinear control, boundary control);

## Community involvement 

I have volunteered for the 58th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control ([CDC 2019](https://cdc2019.ieeecss.org/)) and served as a reviewer for the European Journal of Control, the IMA Journal of Mathematical Control and Information, the IEEE Control Systems Letters, and the IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control. I am also a corresponding member of the IFAC technical commitee on nonlinear control systems ([TC 2.3](https://tc.ifac-control.org/2/3)).
