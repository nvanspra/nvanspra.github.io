title: "Hello there!"
---

I am a postdoctoral research fellow within the [Systems Theory Research Group](https://sysgrouptampere.wordpress.com/) at Tampere University under the supervision of [Lassi Paunonen](https://lassipaunonen.wordpress.com/). 

I did my PhD thesis at GIPSA-lab under the supervision of [Christophe Prieur](http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/~christophe.prieur/) and [Francesco Ferrante](http://www.fferrante.net/).

I graduated from Ecole Centrale de Lyon and Universit√© Claude-Bernard in Engineering and Applied Mathematics in 2019.

## Research interests
* Infinite-dimensional systems theory (stability, frequency-domain analysis, decay rates);
* Stabilization of partial differential equations (nonlinear control, boundary control);
* Semigroup and operator theory in systems and control.

## Community involvement 

I have volunteered for the 58th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control ([CDC 2019](https://cdc2019.ieeecss.org/)) and served as a reviewer for the European Journal of Control, the IMA Journal of Mathematical Control and Information, the IEEE Control Systems Letters, and the IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control. I have also served as a reviewer for [CDC 2021](https://2021.ieeecdc.org/) and [ECC 2022](https://ecc22.euca-ecc.org/), and I am a corresponding member of the IFAC technical commitee on nonlinear control systems ([TC 2.3](https://tc.ifac-control.org/2/3)).
